      <title>Another DELTA Grant Awarded</title>
      <link>https://mathiasunberath.github.io/talk/delta_awards_2019/</link>

      <description>Significance: Machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML &amp;amp; AI) techniques are rapidly becoming a staple in healthcare research, but both healthcare and engineering workforces at Johns Hopkins lag behind in their capacity to advance innovation through interdisciplinary collaboration and to assimilate it into practice. Specifically, healthcare scientists need to understand machine learning algorithms, and engineers need to learn biases in healthcare data that affect performance and utility of algorithms. Addressing these learning needs is critical to foster interdisciplinary collaboration at Johns Hopkins and to enable the School of Medicine to shape the future of healthcare innovations through engineering (Goals 2 and 3 in JHU’s 10 by 20 priorities).</description>

      <title>Malone Center Seed Grant for research on glaucoma prognostication</title>
      <link>https://mathiasunberath.github.io/talk/2019-10-maloneseedgrant/</link>

      <description>Congratulations to my Co-PI Jithin Yohannan on being awarded a Malone Center Seed Grant. Our proposal targets glaucoma prognostication, where we will analyze functional, structural and clinical records to estimate risk of rapid worsening. Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness globally, with approximately 79.6 million people expected to be affected by the disease by 2020. A small subset of glaucoma patients will experience rapid glaucoma worsening that, if untreated, can quickly lead to complete vision loss.</description>

      <title>Two DELTA Grants Awarded</title>
      <link>https://mathiasunberath.github.io/talk/delta_awards/</link>

      <description>Augmented Reality for Immersive 3-D Education in Complex Pelvic Trauma Surgery The key challenge in treating unstable pelvic fractures, the proposal says, is that the doctors have to do mental mapping of plate positioning and screw trajectories to the fractured anatomy, a skill that surgeons-in-training cannot easily acquire from conventional two-dimensional materials. The grant will be used to create a three-dimensional learning environment that incorporates augmented reality.
Personalized Augmented Reality as an Interactive Teaching Tool for Facial Anatomy Anatomy is one of the most challenging subject matters to both teach and learn, and facial anatomy is one of the most complex regions.</description>
