      <description>Augmented Reality for Immersive 3-D Education in Complex Pelvic Trauma Surgery The key challenge in treating unstable pelvic fractures, the proposal says, is that the doctors have to do mental mapping of plate positioning and screw trajectories to the fractured anatomy, a skill that surgeons-in-training cannot easily acquire from conventional two-dimensional materials. The grant will be used to create a three-dimensional learning environment that incorporates augmented reality.
Personalized Augmented Reality as an Interactive Teaching Tool for Facial Anatomy Anatomy is one of the most challenging subject matters to both teach and learn, and facial anatomy is one of the most complex regions.</description>
